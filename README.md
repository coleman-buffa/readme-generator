# Readme Generator

The primary motivations for this project are educational and practical. From a learning standpoint this project was an opportunity to practice using node.js, npm, and a few features of ES6. These features include using function arrows (fat arrow =>), asynchronous programming utilising aysnc functions with await, and variable declarations using const instead of var to name a few. A practical application of these learning goals is a Readme.md generator. Every project requires a good readme so having a standard template generator to kickstart the process will be handy.

## Testing

Add more to license area?
Build in ways to handle different string inputs for project name. Since this endpoint is put directly into the template literal which can break ToC linking, I need a few logical branches to handle all the input cases
